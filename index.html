                  <h2>Burke's</h2>
                  <p>The former Burke's Grocer inhabits a prominent spot on the hill halfway between the north and south harbours. It is fully-plumbed and has a small yard to rear. Could be home to 2+ families if the owners would let go of it. </p>

                  <h2>Bradshaw's House, Baile Iarthach Thuaidh</h2>
                  <p>This beautiful home enjoys panoramic views over the stunning south harbour on Cape Clear Island. The house is relatively dry inside but has been allowed to deteriorate quite a lot. It is currently unplumbed but has stunning original features throughout, including carved oak doors and built-in bookshelves.  </p>

                  <img src="/assets/css/images/cumar_rd.jpeg" alt="white house with red window details" />
                  <h2>Cumar road</h2>
                  <p>Formerly a holiday home, this house has lain vacant since being sold to new owners in 2019. Sea views and close proximity to the local Nationbal School and north harbour pier and shop. The owners of this house have done some renovation work to it here and there but have not made it ready for renters. It is slowly deteriorating into a derelict state. A perfect home for a couple or singles, if only the owners would allow it. </p>

                    <img src="/assets/css/images/haybales.jpeg" alt="white house with boarded up windows" />
                    <h2>South Harbour</h2>
                    <p>This house was in great condition when bought by a French couple years ago but has been left to fall into dereliction. A fine family home with sweeping views of the Atlantic and Fastnet Lighthouse in the distance. It is fully plumbed and dry throughout with a newer roof. Instead of a family, it houses haybales.</p>
