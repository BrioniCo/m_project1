      <p>
        Starting with the island of Cape Clear, our aim is to document each and every vacant home in Ireland.
        <p>The shortage of housing is a crisis that is having a devastating impact on our communities. Cape
          Clear is no exception, where the lack of available housing is threatening the sustainability of the
          island's community.</p>
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem is not just about the lack of new construction, but also about the large number of vacant homes that
        are left unused. In fact, there are an estimated 200,000 vacant homes across Ireland, while at the same time
        thousands of people are struggling to find a place to call home.
      </p>
      <p><i class="fa-regular fa-heart"></i>
      </p>
      <p>
        At the heart of this crisis is the fact that there are vacant homes owned by landlords who have little or no
        interest in renting or selling these properties. Meanwhile, local people are forced to leave their communities
        in search of affordable housing, creating a vicious cycle of depopulation and decline.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our website aims to shed light on this issue and bring attention to the urgent need to address the problem of
        vacant housing.
        Through our platform, we aim to name and shame the worst offenders and help to facilitate the process of
        bringing vacant properties back into use.
      </p>
      <p><i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i>
      </p>
      <p>If you see a vacant or derelict property in your area, we encourage you to REPORT it using our form below.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that everyone has the right to a safe and secure place to call home, and that by working together, we
        can make a real difference to the
        lives of people in our community and beyond.
