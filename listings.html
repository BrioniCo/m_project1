                        <p>Part of this large building once served as Burke's grocer shop on the island. A video from
                            RTE made in 1972 shows it bustling with life.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately it has been allowed to fall into dereliction, despite the fact that it could
                            comfortably house at least three households in its many extensions built over the years.</p>
                        <p>It is a particular shame that this building lies empty as it inhabitas a focal point, at the
                            top of the hill between the north harbour and CDM's bar.</p>
                        <p>This building is owned by an absentee landowner, based in the USA.</p>

                        <p>It is unplumbed and so requires a significant amount of renovation work. Despite this, it is

                        <p>If sold, it could, at the very least, present a new owner with the opportunity to obtain

                        <p>This beautiful home was bought in 2009. It has sat empty since then, despite the worsening
                            housing emergency and the threatened closure of the island's only National school.</p>
                        <p>The owners have performed some sporadic renovations to the home but despite not being in a
                            position to finish the renovations in the past 4 years, they have not passed the house along
                            to someone who needs a home.</p>
                        <p>The house is situated in convenient walking distance to the national school, the main harbour
                            and the local shop.</p>
                        <p>This building is owned by a local landowner, based on the island of Cape Clear.</p>

                        <p>The house and its surrounding land was bought as an inhabited home. It was unfortunately left

                        <p>An extension was built by the former owners and a new roof added. It is fully plumbed with a
                            kitchen and two bathrooms. This beautiful home, perfect for a family, is currently being
                            used to store haybales.</p>

                        <p>This house was once owned by an American woman named Sylvia who was once the island's
                            unofficial DVD rental service provider. She welcomed all in to her extensive DVD library.
                        </p>
                        <p>It is clear that Sylvia was very proud of her home as it was well maintained until it was
                            bought by the current owner.</p>
                        <p>It has beautiful finishings that have been allowed to deteriorate rapidly. A broken velux
                            window on the roof was not fixed by the current owner and so there is now extensive water
                            damage inside.</p>
