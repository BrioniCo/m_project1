          A site dedicated to bringing attention to the critical issue of vacant housing on Cape Clear island and across Ireland. The shortage of housing is a growing problem that is having a devastating impact on local communities. Cape Clear island is no exception, where the lack of available housing is threatening the sustainability of the island's community.
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem is not just about the lack of new construction, but also about the large number of vacant homes that are left unused. In fact, there are an estimated 200,000 vacant homes across Ireland, while at the same time thousands of people are struggling to find a place to call home.
        </p>
        <p><i class="fa-regular fa-heart"></i></p>
        <p>
          At the heart of this crisis is the fact that there are vacant homes owned by landlords who have little or no interest in renting or selling these properties. Meanwhile, local people are forced to leave their communities in search of affordable housing, creating a vicious cycle of depopulation and decline.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our website aims to shed light on this issue and bring attention to the urgent need to address the problem of vacant housing. Through our platform, we aim to name and shame the worst offenders and help to facilitate the process of bringing vacant properties back into use.
        </p>
        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i></p>
        <p>If you see a vacant or derelict property in your area, we encourage you to REPORT it using our form below.</p>
        <p>
          We believe that everyone has the right to a safe and secure place to call home, and that by working together, we can make a real difference to the lives of people in our community and beyond. Thank you for visiting our website, and we invite you to join us in our mission to tackle the housing crisis and build a better future for all.
