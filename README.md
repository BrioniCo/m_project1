# **_NOHOME.ie_**

NOHOME.ie is a parody property-listings site set up to create further awareness of the issue of vacant housing in Ireland. The listings on the site include vacant and derelict properties on the island of Cape Clear with scope to expand nationwide. 
 The site is part of a campaign/mission to document as many vacant and derelict houses in Ireland. It is the hope that this may encourage the owners of these properties to put them back into use. 
 The site is aimed at anyone with an interest in the housing crisis in Ireland, a pressing topic at present. 

Welcome to the campaign <a href="https://brionico.github.io/m_project1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NOHOME.ie</a>

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals
    
    1.  As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the campaign.
        
        1.  Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with Text and a "Search Properties" Call to action button.
        2.  The main points are made immediately with the text over the hero image and the colour scheme which is dark and serious. 
        3.  The user has two options, click the call to action buttons or navigate to the About or Listings sections on the header. 

    2.  As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.
        
        1.  The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
        2.  At the bottom of the first 3 pages there is a redirection call to action to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.
    3.  As a First Time Visitor, I want to locate social media links to see the campaign's following on social media and to get a further sense of what the campaign is all about. These social media links are placed at the bottom of the page. It is good practice to locate them in the footer if the social media is not updated very reguarly. If the social media pages were to be quite active, I would want to relocate them to the header. 
        
        1.  Once the new visitor has read the About and Property Listings text, they will notice the ____.
        2.  The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
        3.  At the bottom of the Contact Us page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the organisation on social media which highlights the links to them.

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals
    
    1.  As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the new vacant property listings.
        
        1.  These are clearly shown in divs beneath the call to action section on the home page.
        2.  They will be directed to a page with another hero image and some additional information.
    2.  As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the campaigners with any questions I may have.
        
        1.  The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contribute" Page.
        2.  Here they can fill out the form on the page or are told that alternatively they can message the organisation on social media.
        3.  The header contains links to the organisations Facebook and Instagram page.
        4.  Whichever link they click, it will be open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.
        5.  As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the Facebook Group link so that I can join and interact with others in the community.
        
        6.  The Facebook Page can be found at the header of every page and will open a new tab for the user.
       
      
-   #### Frequent User Goals
    
    1.  As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any updates to the campaign or news.
        
        1.  The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the banner message.
    2.  As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new features such as blog posts.
        
        1.  The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the blog link
    3.  As a Frequent User, I want to sign up to the Newsletter so that I am emailed any major updates and/or changes to the website or organisation.
        
        1.  At the bottom of every page their is a footer which content is consistent throughout all pages.
        2.  To the right hand side of the footer the user can see "Subscribe to our Newsletter" and are prompted to Enter their email address.
        3.  There is a "Submit" button to the right hand side of the input field which is located close to the field and can easily be distinguished.


## Wireframes

The wireframes for NOHOME.ie were produced in [Figma](https://figma.com). 
There are wireframes for a full width display/ desktop display. 
Please note that the final site varies slightly from the wireframes. As the learning process developed, so too did the look of the site.

![Index/Home wireframe image](assets/readme-images/wireframes_index.png)

![Listings wireframe image](assets/readme-images/wireframes_listings.png)
 ![About wireframe image](assets/readme-images/wireframes_about.png) 

[Back to top](<#contents>)

## Site Structure

NOHOME.ie website has three pages. The [home page](index.html) is the default loading page, the[listings](listings.html) and [about](about.html) pages are all accessible primarily from the navigation menu. 
There is another link to the *about* page in the The *Record* button on the homepage also takes you to the form on the *about* page. 
![Record button link to About](assets/readme-images/record_button.png)
The *here* in *Click here to view the house you'll never have* takes the user to the Listings page. 
![Alt link to Listings page](assets/readme-images/search-bar-feature.png)
*Home* is linked from the logo on every page. 

[Back to top](<#contents>)

## Design Choices

 * ### Typography
      The fonts chosen were 'Roboto for the headings and 'Lato' for the body text. They both have a fall back of sans-serif set. 
     *  'Roboto' was chosen for the headings as it has a little more imact than the 'Lato' font.  For this reason it made the headings and the logo stand out. 
     * Lato was chosen as it is quite close to the type of font typically seen in property listings sites. It has a casual and welcoming feel. 
      The two fonts compliment each other well.
 

 * ### Colour Scheme
 * The site itself is understated and simple and for this reason, aside from the images, there is an absence of any dominating colour scheme. Instead the site rotates around a subdued palette of white and grey shot with flashes of forest green that pull out and accentuate the greens in the images. 

The colour used most predominantly throughout the site was a dark green rgb colour *rgb(40, 61, 38)*. It was used with varying degrees of transparency.  This colour was chosen both because of how it brought out the subtle greens in the images as well as how it brings to mind the mossy greens and earthy hues associated with houses that have fallen into dereliction. 
The green was paired with greys and blacks and sometimes a soft brown-black shade, *#251919*. 
![Colour Palate image](assets/readme-images/rgb_color.png)![Colour Palate image HEX](assets/readme-images/hex.png)
To avoid the use of additional colours that would compete with the images, a shadow effect was used to separate the navigation bar from the rest of the page and the footer from the rest of the page.
![Shadow contrast](assets/readme-images/shadow-for-contrast.png)

# Features

NOHOME.ie is set up to be welcoming and easy to navigate. 
The images are of the utmost importance as they most effectively convey the purpose of the site, which is to draw attention to the problem of dereliction and vacant housing in Ireland. 

This is not a showy site- the aim was for the content and the images to speak for themselves and communicate the main thrust of the site. 

Nestled within the site are some features that the user is likely to be familiar with, such as a navigation bar, a submission form and a search bar with a drop-down selector. 
 
The overall feel of the website is intended to be hard-hitting and serious but with an inviting leaning. The intention is to clearly communicate the mission and encourage the user to explore further, learn more and possibly contribute to the campaign.  

## Existing Features  
  * ### Navigation Menu

    * The navigation bar is located at the top of all the pages in the site. It is fully responsive and contains links to all the pages of the site. This ensures ease of navigation throughout the site. 
    * The logo is clickable with a link back to the home page for enhanced UX.

![Navigation bar image](assets/readme-images/header.png)
[Back to top](<#contents>)

  * ### Tag Line/ Introduction

      - Located on the home page over the hero image is text that communicates the mission statement of the campaign. 
     -Beneath the text is a search bar with a drop-down selector that lists the words *no* *one* *is* and *home*. The intention of this is to further enhance the hard-hitting element of the campaign. 
     The placeholder message on the search bar tells the user to "Search for your (in) Dream(s) Home".
     There is also a link to the listings page embedded in the text. 
![Gallery image](assets/readme-images/search-bar-feature.png)
[Back to top](<#contents>)

  * ### Listings
    * The *Listings* section is the backbone of the site. It is where the images and accompanying information about featured vacant and derelict homes are listed.  
    * Each image box has an added zoom effect to add interest and movement to the listings. 
    * The heart icon on the top right corner of each listing is reminiscent of the property listings sites many are familiar with. 
    * The listings boxes copy the format that property listings usually take, except none of these properties are for sale- they are all vacant and/or derelict. Instead, each listing has a bit of a back-story and context. 
    ![Listings page image](assets/readme-images/listings-boxes.png)
    * An iframes of a Google Maps link gives the user added perspective and a sense of place. 

![Google Maps iframe](assets/readme-images/i_frames.png)
[Back to top](<#contents>)

  * ### About
    The *About* section reiterates for the user what the aim of the NOHOME.ie campaign is. 
    * The hero image of a door surrounded by overgrown foliage once again communicates the issue of dereliction and waste. The image is enhanced with a subtle zoom effect. The intention is to draw the user towards the door and pique interest. 
    * There is a large button with an embedded link to the *Record a Vacant Home* form on the same page, once again encourging the user to contribte to the campaign. The button flickers to transparent when it is hovered over, allowing the image below to bleed through. 

![About image with button](assets/readme-images/large_report_button.png)

  * ### Welcome to NOHOME.ie

    * This information section provides further context to the user .... 
    * They are styled in a box with green border to....
    * This information section will change as the campaign grows and the scope of it spreads nationwide.

![About Section](assets/readme-images/about-welcome.png)
[Back to top](<#contents>)

* ### Footer
    
    * Contains social media links. To enhance the UX the links open in other tabs.
    * The social media presence will help the user with their research into the NOHOME.ie campaign and will also encourage them to contribute to and involve themselves with the mission.
    * Note that the decision has been made to exclude any links to *Twitter*. It is the developers opinion that this site is rapidly falling out of favour since becoming an unregulated platform and it would not be in good taste to include a link to such a site. A link to Mastodon has been included as a reasonable alternative.   
    * The decision was made to include the social media images on the footer rather than on the header as it is accepted practice that for sites that update social media content less reguarly, (which will be the case with NOHOME.ie until it is established further), the social media links should be located here.  
![Footer image](assets/readme-images/#.png)
[Back to top](<#contents>)

* ### Contact Us

    * This brief section includes the email address for applying to join the mailing list as well as some copyright information. 
    As this site is for a campaign and not a business, it is not necessary to include an address and so this has been omitted. 
    * In case the user would like to contact Wawas Woods directly there is an e-mail link icon. It opens the user's default email provider with an email addressed to Wawas Woods.
    * There is a form that the user can choose to fill in. It has 5 input fields, name, email, address, callback and a textarea. The call back button lets Wawas Woods know if the user would like a callback.

![Contact Us page image](assets/readme-images/contact-us2.png)

* ### Record a Vacant Home Form
    * This form..... for the user that their details have been sent to Wawas Woods. For this project it validates the form only.

# Deployment

### **To deploy the project**
The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy a site are as follows:
  1.It is important to first ensure that you have commited and pushed any recent changes in your gitpod.io workspace, do this first by typing: *git add .* then press *return* in the terminal window, followed by *git commit -m "ADD NOTES HERE"*, press *return* and, finally *git push*. You are now ready to deploy. 
  2. Open GitHub and from the menu on the left, choose your repository. 
  3. In the GitHub repository, navigate to the **Settings** tab on the top right corner. 
![Settings Tab](assets/readme-images/settings.png)4. Once in Settings, navigate to the **Pages** tab on the left hand side.
5. Scroll to **Source**, select the branch **main**, then click save. 
![GitHub deployed image](assets/readme-images/deployment-instructions.png)6. The page should refresh. You may need to manually refresh a few times. As you can see from the image above, your deployed site address should display across a ribbon display. 

**Note**: For my first deployment, I needed to choose a Jekyll theme in order to have my site deployed. Github has instructions for this eventuality : [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll)
 
  The live link to the Github repository can be found here - https://brionico.github.io/m_project1/

### **To fork the repository on GitHub**
A copy of the GitHub Repository can be made by forking the GitHub account. This copy can be viewed and changes can be made to the copy without affecting the original repository. Take the following steps to fork the repository;
1. Log in to **GitHub** and locate the [repository](https://github.com/EwanColquhoun/wawaswoods).
2. On the right hand side of the page inline with the repository name is a button called **'Fork'**, click on the button to create a copy of the original repository in your GitHub Account.
![GitHub forking process image](assets/readme-images/forking.png)
